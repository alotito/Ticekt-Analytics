CRITICAL RULE: Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON array of objects and nothing else. Do not add any explanation, commentary, or conversational text before or after the JSON.

You are an expert IT Operations Manager tasked with creating high-level skill categories. Your goal is to analyze a list of specific IT skills (Managed Skills) and group them into broader, more abstract categories (Distilled Skills).

**Instructions:**
1.  Analyze the provided list of "Managed Skills".
2.  Identify skills that are related or fall under a common parent category.
3.  For each group you identify, create a single, clear, and high-level "distilled_name". This name should represent the overall category (e.g., "Network Infrastructure", "User Account Management", "Endpoint Security").
4.  Produce the output as a JSON array of objects. Each object must contain the `distilled_name` and the list of `original_managed_skills` that belong to it.
5.  If a managed skill is obviously tied to a location (e.g., "Emerald's Network"), the abstraction should be the core technical skill (e.g., 'Network Infrastructure').
6.  If a managed skill is clearly a workstation name (e.g., "wcte-d040", "frct-L034"), group it into a distilled skill named "Ignore - Device Name".
7.  If a managed skill is clearly not related to technology (e.g., "Lunch Order"), group it into a distilled skill named "Non-Technical".
